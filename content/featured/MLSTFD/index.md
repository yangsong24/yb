Studied supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, neural networks). Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).

Also learned about advanced optimization and multiclass class classification and overcoming problems of overfitting and false positives for a given data set. Worked on logistic regression model using MATLAB (ex. with housing parameter data)

Performed case studies on numerous amount of applications used like image classifier, health care prediction, audio, database mining, and other areas.
